# home-bots
Robotics at home using the robot operating system ROS2.

Here I experiment with robotics at home to create interesting robots that make life at home easier or generally just more fun.
I plan on first developing robots virtually using Gazebo simulations and later build them in real life.
My plan for this repo is to contain several ros packages for different robots and scenarios as well as some form of documentation of my experiences.
